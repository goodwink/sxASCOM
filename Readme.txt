This is the README.txt for version 3.0

This is an UNSTABLE release of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras,
which contains new, untested or lightly tested code and will expire.

There is a STABLE release available - please use that version if it meets
your needs.

This is the first release of the ICamera2/ASCOM 6 version of the sxASCOM
driver. In order to use this version of the driver you will have to upgrade
your ASCOM platform to version 6.

There has been a substancial reorganization of the driver, but there is
not all that much new code, so while I'm sure there will be a few issues
I don't expect too many problems (famous last words...)

This version adds:
    - iCamera2/ASCOM 6 support
    - a configuration option for dumping camera data for offline analysis
    - a configuration option for using dumped camera data offline for analysis

With the exception of the Bayer matrix informational features (which needs 
a firmware tweak from Starlight Xpress to fully implement) I belive this is 
a complete ICamera2/ASCOM 6 implementation (and the ASCOM 6 conform agrees).

If you have problems, please join the sxAscom Yahoo group at 
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sx-ascom/join and let me know
what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.
