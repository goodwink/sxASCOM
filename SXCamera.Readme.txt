This is the README.txt for version 6.0.0.0





I have changed my version numbering scheme - this is the the version that 
would have been 3.0 before.  The first two numbers now indicate the miniumum
version of ASCOM that must be installed.


This is a Release build of the ASCOM driver for Starlight Xpress cameras.

This version adds:



    - ASCOM 6.0 and ICameraV2 support

what they are.

Thanks to everyone involved and clear skies.
